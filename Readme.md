java 2 version with N/T rows assigned to a single thread and in total there are T threads
thread counts of, say, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, and 48 should suffice

speed analysis


implementation of java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier. why the fuck do I want htis thing in this case. 

speed test against --glider

Question. where to set up the multithreaded thing in this setup ??
QUESTIOO.


onRunClick() triggers the threads to create and run
who takes cares of what, stuff like
dogeneration inside lifeboard is the actually calculation and logic


mutliple workers
do generation probably be splited into the N/T and pass a parameter for the part it will cover for the lifeboard


multip0le works
